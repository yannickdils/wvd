Once you enroll your device to your workplace environment or Azure AD, your organization will be able to manage your PC and collect information about you (including your location). It might add or remove apps or content, change settings, disable features, prevent you from removing your company account, or reset your PC.”. The OOBE part means “out-of-box experience”.  This trace records events around domain or Azure AD join.  Normally provisioned VDI VMs are already joined, so this logging is unnecessary."

    "Description": "“ReadyBoot is boot acceleration technology that maintains an in-RAM cache used to service disk reads faster than a slower storage medium such as a disk drive”.  VDI does not use “normal” computer disk devices, but usually segments of a shared storage medium.  ReadyBoot and other optimizations designed to assist normal disk devices do not have equivalent effects on shared storage devices.  And further, for non-persistent VDI, 99.999% of computer state is discarded when the user logs off.  This includes any optimizations performed by the OS during runtime.  Therefore, why allow Windows “normal” optimizations when all that computer and I/O work will be discarded at logoff for NP VDI?  For persistent, the choice is yours.  Another consideration is again, pooled VDI.  The users will normally not log into the same VM twice.  Therefore, any RAM caching of predicted I/O will have unknown impact because the underlying disk extent being utilized for that logon session will be different from session to session."

Current buffers are 4, buffer size is 16.  Those numbers reflect the amount of physical RAM reserved for this trace.  Because my VM does not use WLAN, AKA “wireless”, this trace is doing nothing for my VM now, and will not as long as I do not use wireless.  Therefore the recommendation to disable this trace and free these resources."
